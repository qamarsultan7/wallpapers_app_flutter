# wallpapers_app_flutter

A new Flutter project.
## I've developed an impressive Flutter app using the Pixels.com API, incorporating Provider State Management and following a clean MVVM architecture. ðŸ’«ðŸ™Œ

Now, effortlessly change your mobile wallpaper with just one click, whether it's for the home screen or lock screen, offering a lot of choices. ðŸ˜‰

If you find a picture you love, easily download it to your mobile storage in a dedicated folder for future use. ðŸ«‚
